        <p>Civil and Human Rights are fundamental rights. Throughout the creation of life, these rights have been
          misinterpreted and eradicated. This project will address the issues that caused us to have laws to protect our
          natural human rights. It is a constant struggle to maintain these rights, and this scheme will bring attention
          to why we need to continue fighting. Solving this issue will make society a more pleasant place to live by
          protecting the freedoms you are given simply for being a human.</p>
